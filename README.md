### Air Quality Index Analysis and Visualization Project

Welcome to the Air Quality Index Analysis and Visualization Project by Mohana Krishna Alla. This project is designed to demonstrate the power of data by transforming complex air quality data into insightful and interactive visualizations.

## Overview

This initiative takes on the challenge of analyzing air quality data by applying ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques. Leveraging Python's robust libraries, the project reads from a CSV dataset, processes the information, and produces visualizations that make the data accessible and understandable.

## Project Setup

To engage with the project, follow these steps:

**Project Overview**

The Python script achieves the following:

- Reads air quality data, including pollutant concentrations and AQI metrics, from a CSV file.
- Processes this data within a pandas DataFrame, performing operations like datetime conversion and aggregation.
- Utilizes Plotly to create interactive plots that visualize trends and patterns in the data.
- Employs matplotlib for additional static charting capabilities, suitable for reports or printed materials.

**Prerequisites**

Before starting, ensure that the following tools are installed on your system:

- Python 3.x: [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pandas, NumPy, Plotly, and matplotlib Python libraries.

**Python Dependencies**

Install the required Python libraries by running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy plotly matplotlib
